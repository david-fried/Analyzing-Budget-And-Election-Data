## Using Python to Perform Simple Analyses

There are two py files, PyBank and PyPoll, with two corresponding data sets (not present in repository): budget_data.csv and election_data.csv, respectively.

### PyBank
#### budget_data.csv
The data set is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses
Python script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
   The total number of months included in the dataset
   The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
   The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
   The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
   The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period



### PyPoll
#### election_data.csv
The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate
Python script analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
   The total number of votes cast
   A complete list of candidates who received votes
   The percentage of votes each candidate won
   The total number of votes each candidate won
   The winner of the election based on popular vote
